This program reads a directory full of music and makes a list of your MP3 files.

What the project does -This project was just an experiment to write something simple and yet graphical using C++

Why the project is useful
•	The program is useful because it can collect all your song names in a form you could export and do almost anything with. For instance, share with a friend.

How users can get started with the project
•	I placed the source code here for playing around. Also, the distribution is here with just the executable and manual as if it were freeware.

Who maintains and contributes to the project?
•	No one updates this and it was just a weekend project.
•	Feel free to add to this and add your own creativity but give me credit. I won't add more unless I get inspired.


Cheers mate,
~ Tracy
