This program reads a folder full of MP3 music and makes a list of your MP3 files in a more clean manner.

What the project does ->> This project was just an experiment to write something simple and yet had a form or graphical interface using C++

Why is the project useful ->>	The program is useful because it can collect all your song names in a form you could export and do almost anything with. For instance, I have a thumb-drive with 4000 songs in my car.  This helps print a clean list I can review when thinking about a song I might want to play aside from shuffle.

How users can get started with the project ->>	I placed the source code here for playing around. Also, the distribution is here with just the executable and manual as if it were freeware.  

Who maintains and contributes to the project? ->>	No regular updates this are happening as it was just a weekend project. Feel free to add to this and add your own creativity but give me credit. I won't add more unless I get inspired.


Cheers mate,
