This program reads a folder full of MP3 music and makes a list of your MP3 files in a more clean manner.  It then can alphabetize your entire list.  This gets interesting with songs like the one from TOOL called... (-)ions.  The only restriction is that the music has to be in this form "White Christmas - Bing Crosby.mp3" where the song comes first and the artist comes second with a dash in between.  The program goes down into all subfolders from the root of the path you give. Lastly it numbers the lines of music so you can quickly get a count of the songs in that directory.  This helps a bit with duplicates once you see all songs alphabetized.  Need to send a clean list of your songs to a friend?  This might be your program.

9199  Hello Again - Hoobastank.mp3

9200  Hello Again - Lost Prophets.mp3

9201  Hello Again - The Cars.mp3

9202  Hello Dolly - Louis Armstrong.mp3

What the project does ->> This project was just an experiment to write something simple but had to have a form or graphical user interface (GUI) using C++ only.  I mean most colleges teach for years but you stay using command line unless you go to another language.

Why is the project useful ->>	The program is useful because it can collect all your song names in a text file you could export and do almost anything with. For instance, I have a thumb-drive with 4000 songs in my car.  This helps print a clean list I can review when thinking about a song I might want to play aside from shuffle.

How users can get started with the project ->>	There is no install and you can simply run the executable.  The documentation is present. I placed the source code here for playing around. Also, the distribution is here with just the executable and manual as if it were freeware.  Keep in mind I had to tell my MalwareBytes the programming folder was off limits so it didn't throw a fit about the executable.

Who maintains and contributes to the project? ->>	No regular updates to this are happening as it was just a weekend project. Feel free to add to this and add your own creativity but give me credit. I won't add more unless I get inspired.

Future additions might be to calculate percent of similar songs to weed out duplicates.  Maybe an HTML page with the list and when you click a radio box it sends that song name to a 'favorites' list?

Cheers mate,
